A collaborative Kanban board application inspired by Trello, built with React, Vite, NestJS, and MongoDB.

> **Note:** The repository is currently updating.

## Features

- **User Dashboard**: Each user has a dashboard with three main sections:
  - All kanbans (personal boards)
  - Create new kanban
  - Shared kanbans (boards shared by others)

- **Kanban Boards**: Boards resemble Trello with three default columns:
  - To Do
  - In Progress
  - Done

- **Drag and Drop**: Easily move cards between columns using drag and drop functionality.

- **Sharing**: Share your kanban boards with other users. Shared boards appear in the recipient's "Shared Kanbans" panel.

- **User Ownership**: Each user owns their own kanbans, with the ability to share them collaboratively.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Vite for fast development and building
- **Backend**: NestJS for scalable server-side logic
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage
